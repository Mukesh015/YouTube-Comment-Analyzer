in this video you said, python is easy language and can be understood by 5th standard students.<br><br><br>let me tell you, due to your very efficient, easy language teaching methodology, my son ,&quot;maahir patel&quot; who is studying in 3rd standard had completed learning of python language followed by numpy, pandas, meyplotlib, scikit learn and more importantly machine learning.....<br><br><br>now, through your video tutorial, he is heading towards, deep learning.....<br><br><br>many thanks to you.<br>good may gives you lots of joy in your life...ðŸ˜Š
python has all concepts that normal langauage has tensorflow api are in python and node so programming is important.
super work
he looks so generous.
first time visitor
very good explanation sir, you are talking clearly, i can also understand clearly, my research also in deep learning
can you make a tutorial about multiple instance learning?
@codebasics (dhaval) do you mind making tutorial on doing machine learning and deep learning using pure cpp, since you are already having the background of the working in cpp and in dl. it will be a  great help for all the learners out there.
much initiative
thsnkddd
meri laptop mai graphic thk nhi hain sir...mai deep learning kaha se sikhuuu
thank you sir for thinking to make deep learning simple. my question is can i implement regression on data using dl if so which network would you suggest
thank you
how is deep learning different from artificial neural network??
wow!  great job introducing deep learning. i had no idea of google and ai first approach.
i appreciate the efforts you put into the video and explained cnn in a very simple way. very useful. again thanks a lot.
hi <br>thanks allot <br><br>do you have a source book that you take your deep learning from it .<br>i will very glad to tell me , if you have one.
amazing explanation sir
can you also create tutorial for device drivers,rtos,embedded system design
practical applications like driver-less cars, have made companies curious to see if they can harness it to deliver a competitive business advantage...
i thinks dhaval sir is the data science guru more than 10% of upcoming  data scientist in india.
sir can you please give me your email address
i can see ur wallet behind, full of money,  seems data scientist is high paying :)
awesome tutorials, if possible please make a video on installation of tensorflow and pytorch
amazing content. i am not from computer engineering background. but i am able to understand code basics tutorials. thank you so much.
thanks for the video... you said in your statement, that python is very easy to learn. please, how can i learn phyton?
many thanks
hello sir, your videos are very informative, they are very easy to understand and learn. thank you for starting tutorial on this subject. it would be great if you include one session on how to install any deep learning framework on laptop. that will help us practice.
kids watch netflix series <br>legends watch codebasics series ðŸ˜…<br>dhaval bhai thanks for taking this topic <br>definitely following your videos will make such complex topics simpler
very nice
let me tell you something sir, i am addicted to your tutorials more than netflix !!!! ðŸ˜€
plz upload more videos
sir please upload deep learning videos as soon as possible
great job, on every vÃ­deo!
great videos sir. thanks for the videos. sir, i wanted to work on text to speech synthesis using deep learning. please tell me the minimum hardware requirements for my work.
me : how much data do you need ?<br>ml : it depends<br>dl  : check with dhaval<br>dp :  watch my new web series deep learning
great sir, waiting for the video. as you made videos on projects like bengaluru house prediction, sports person classifier, power bi project... plz upload deep learning project videos too at end of this series...
i would be the first one to join eagerly waiting for the tutorial from the best person on youtube
