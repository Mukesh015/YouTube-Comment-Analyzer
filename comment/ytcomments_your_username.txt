that is a fantastic tutorial and just perfect for us to be creative yet have guidance throughout the project! thank you!
please provide dataset link. am unable to figure it out.
power query so much easier than regex, but i feel like regex may give more freedom in extreme cases. i am still some what new to the field and have only really dealt with clean data.
any nfl football projects?
impressed by great command you have on all this coding work and data analyses--- trying to be on your footsteps
i found this project to be quite disappointing. it felt more like a brand promotion than a comprehensive tutorial. the instructor didn&#39;t complete the web scraping section and only covered half of the data preprocessing. the most frustrating part was the incomplete power bi segment. while the instructor may be skilled in their field, this course lacks the thorough guidance necessary for teaching.üò†üò†üò†

sir i did not get the 15$ balance in my account when i use the link you give in the description what can i do please help
quick question, 37 minutes in, we get to connecting the batting and match df&#39;s. i curiously printed the number of unique values for &#39;match&#39; from batting and &#39;match_id&#39; from match summary. i did this in case one of the games played in the group stage played again in the knockout stage.  as i thought, there are 42 unique matches in batting df played by team1 and team2, yet 45 match-id&#39;s in the match summary. will this get addressed later in the video? p.s. other than this question, love the tutorial and all the other work on pandas you provide in a playlist. üëç

sir can please do some moto racing projects like f1, motogp.  it will also different sports dataset and its near 21 matchdays in every year i think we will get knowledge in racing sports.
sir thanks for your handwork for building this educative video, please make tutorials explaining the data scraping part, especially the complex one.
i was very eager to learn but don&#39;t know anything about cricket, sorry lost interest! love all your other videos tho!!
can we also factor in the pitch report. if it was favourable for a fast bowler then the data for pacers will be skewed and if it was favourable for spinner then data for spinners will be skewed.
can we leave out peak performance parts of the journey as they are usually outliers for the data.(correct me if i&#39;m wrong)
can we also factor in the no. of reviews left for third umpire.<br>example:- according to data kohli was out for 39 for a particular match but the thing was he was actually not out and unfortunately india didn&#39;t have a review left.  so even if kohli was not out according to the data he was out for 39 although he could have scored more runs.
can we also factor in the number of times a player gets injured. <br>example:- bumrah is a really great bowler but he&#39;s often injured so we usually can&#39;t take a player who&#39;s injured half of the time.
can we also factor in the city or the place where the match took place. playing on home ground always provides an extra advantage to the player.
can we factor in the team against whom the runs were made or the wickets were taken. like factoring the relative strength of the opponent as compared to other opponents. <br>example:- scoring 200 against australia or england vs scoring 200 against zimbabwe.
can anyone help in signing up at bright data i am having error please confirm you are not a robot but not showing anything where i can select something that i am not a bot.
