thank you so much.❤❤.  from bangladesh🇧🇩
cant we get this course in english?
awesome thank you so much mam
thanks
first of all it is very useful video to those who really want to learn. i am really appreciating your efforts for  making this video. i would like to inform one more thing which i have observed while learning. in tuples, dictionary, sets section there is an clumsiness of video editing, if you check one more time there is misplacing of problem solving part of dictionaries which is placed after tuples and there is no problem solving of tuples. and also in dictionaries regarding dictionary part 2 there is an explanation video missing regarding the functions but mentioned in the pycharm. after that nested dictionaried started. please check and added it once which helps more. thank you anyways.😍
notes kha se milega iska
i can’t explain what you help me it’s mean a lot for me thank you so much mam❤

thank you❤❤❤❤
hi im civil enginner its possible coming to it data analytics
you have missed too many important steps in this video. you are explaining one step, but without completing that step, you have jumped to another step many times, and those who are learning data analytics for the first time will not be able to understand. secondly, there are many cuts in these videos. your tutor was explaining something, and suddenly she moved on to another topic. this is happening because your video editor has not merged those videos carefully. i appreciate you making this video, but still, be careful while uploading it. please watch the video before uploading it.
i request for ...bussiness analyst one shot ... please provide us ❤😊
if you use your language in instruction then please put that in the title, so we do not need to come here and get disappointed
mam ky commerce student kar sakte hai

you even cover advance topic in mysql that&#39;a amazing
i have done masters in economics....how can i make my career in this field.... would anybody let me know
left shift right shift operator are wrong
what makes your video better than everyone else&#39;s is you answer chote se chote unpopular sawal that i get in my brain. 🤎 thanks !
why did you skip &#39;dictionary functions part 2 ?
bitwise right shift: shifts the bits of the number to the right and fills 0 on voids left( fills 1 in the case of a negative number) as a result. similar effect as of dividing the number with some power of two.<br>example: <br><br>example 1: a = 10 = 0000 1010 (binary) a &gt;&gt; 1 = 0000 0101 = 5 example 2: a = -10 = 1111 0110 (binary) a &gt;&gt; 1 = 1111 1011 = -5
you called right shift as left shift and vice versa, please check it once.
i want to become a business analyst. should i go for this course?
thanks thanks thanks love you guys
please and please, is there an english version of this course?
my name is ayush singh 😂😂
